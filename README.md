# state-federal-datasets

This is a list of various datasets that are collected by States initially and then provided to federal agencies.

I'm curious to see how many Federal datasets originate at the State level and then are provided to Federal agencies.
In the context of Open Data, States may be reluctant to publish datasets that are collected in accordance with Federal
programs or with Federal Funds. There may be Federal rules, laws, guidance, etc that may dictate what States
can do with this data. Further, this may raise issues or questions for operators of Open Data Repositories such as: Can I or should I publish data on a State Repository that is already published by a Federal Agency.

Categories are based on the G8 National Action Plan definition of "high value datasets" used in the U.S. Open Data Institute State Data Census:

The accompanying .csv file (state fed data.csv) contains datasets that I have identified thus far. Contributions via pull request would be gladly accepted.
